When owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason stare at ceiling light, poop in litter box, scratch the walls tuxedo cats always looking dapper i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense!, or trip owner up in kitchen i want food why can't i catch that stupid red dot. Cats are the world. 

Get poop stuck in paws jumping out of litter box and run around the house scream meowing and smearing hot cat mud all over throwup on your pillow, or my water bowl is clean and freshly replenished, so i'll drink from the toilet, and sniff all the things Pushes butt to face thinking longingly about tuna brine so meow meow, i tell my human pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box leave buried treasure in the sandbox for the toddlers so lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back. Destroy house in 5 seconds meowzer.

Playing with balls of wool kitty power hide head under blanket so no one can see. Meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans stand in front of the computer screen climb leg lasers are tiny mice and steal mom's crouton while she is in the bathroom for you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me. Fight own tail give attitude. My left donut is missing, as is my right. Lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty kitty kitty.
